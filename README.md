# Socket Programming C Source Codes

## 1. _TCP - Transmission Control Protocol_

### A. Chat App

Using this code the client and server can perform a half duplex communication, i.e. the server can send a message to the client and upon recieving that message the client can response with another messsage

### B. Q1

A simple Server acknowledgement code. Server sends a greeting message to client upon successful connection

### C. Q3

Server-Client Code that sends the current Date and Time to the Client upon connection with the Server and the Client displays that message

### D. Q5

Server-Client code in which the Client sends a string to the Server which is returned after doing operations on it, in this case, conversion to upper case

### E. Q7

Server-Client Code in which the Server fetches and displays a file for a client.

## 2. _UDP - User Datagram Protocol_

### A. Q2

Server-Client code to establish connection b/w the client and the server using the User Datagram Protocol

### B. Q4

Same as TCP>Q3, using UDP

### C. Q6

Same as TCP>Q5, using UDP


**Note:** These Codes work only in a Linux Environment

**How to Run:** _Compile using gcc in Linux, first run the server and then the client_
